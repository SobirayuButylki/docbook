You must have Ruby installed in order to use this build chain.

Download Ruby for Windows from http://www.rubyinstaller.org/ and install it.
Be sure to let it add Ruby interpreters to your path and then run the following command from the Command Prompt:

  gem install rake

This will ensure you have everything installed correctly. Once you've done that, you can continue with this installation.
