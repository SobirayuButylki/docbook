= Short Attention Span Docbook

This package makes it easy for you to set up all of the tools you need to start authoring books and articles
with the open-source Docbook toolchain. 

Contained in this package are the Docbook XSLT stylesheets, a validation package, XML-FO to PDF translation, and
a project generator with build scripts.

This package is designed for developers who want to integrate this into their existing programs. End users should
download the re-distributable packages available at http://www.napcs.com/products/docbook.

This uses the dookbook-xsl-ns stylesheets.

== Upgrading from previous versions

Due to changes in the way things worked, your best bet is to generate a new project for your book and move your xml files and images into this new project, then add your customizations into the pdf.xsl file manually. Code highlighting customizations are different now. If you're not getting code highlighting to work, generate a new book and review the new makefile and the new pdf.xsl file. Also note that entities are included in the projects and the new templates use them. 

== Changes

2009-09-18 - v1.1

* Highlighting support works differently which changes a lot of the process. You now have to include two stylesheets instead of one in your customization layer, and the highlighting customizations needed to be changed as well. This forced me to change how stylesheets are included. This will break your existing projects, but just generate a new book and move your xml files into the new project. If you've made customizations, manually move those into the pdf.xsl file
* The stylesheets now take the path parameter via an external XML property, which is set in the make file. You need the new make file to make things work on your projects.
* Added support for entitites
* Updated FOP to 0.9.5
* Updated stylesheets to 1.75.2
* Updated XSLHL to 2.0.2 and added in the support for Javascript, C#, and INI files.
